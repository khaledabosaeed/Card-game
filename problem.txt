the scenario for the game 
=> start with login screen take the name (name from here)
=> level screen take the level (level)
=> after this we have the game screen (cardList , name , level)

the name and level is stata update 
- so put it in reducers and use the reducer in game screen to displaying the game 
- need context to across the name and the level 
- 
the problem now how assign the value to the name and the level and when 
??
so lets say i will create the reducer to update the value
