🧠 Memory Match Game
A clean, scalable, and beginner-friendly memory card game built with modern web technologies.

🎮 Game Overview
Memory Match is a simple yet engaging card-matching game where players flip cards to find pairs. The game challenges memory, attention, and focus across multiple difficulty levels.

Players select their name and desired level, then begin flipping cards. If two cards match, the player earns points. If not, both cards flip back. The game tracks attempts, elapsed time, and displays a final score screen to compare player performance.

🧱 Project Structure
The app is divided into three main screens, each with clear, reusable components:

🧍‍♂️ Login Screen
LoginComponent: Collects player name and game level.

🎲 Game Screen
GameHeader: Displays current score, level, player name, attempt count, timer, and replay option.

CardComponent: Represents each game card (handles flipping/matching logic).

CardsGrid: Renders the full grid of cards based on the selected level.

🏆 Score Screen
ScoreBoard: Displays player rankings with names and final scores.

⚙️ Engineering Philosophy
This project is not just about building a game—it's about building with clarity, scalability, and real-world readiness in mind:

Component-based architecture for reusability and clean separation of concerns.

State management and logic isolation to prepare for future expansions like multiplayer, animations, or backend integration.

Codebase designed as if you're working in a production team—future-proof and easy to onboard.

Whether you're a beginner or a pro, this project shows how thinking like a real company engineer makes your code more powerful—even if you're working solo.
